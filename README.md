# Machine Unlearning HK 
A shared learning space for [2023 Kaggle competition "Machine unlearning"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-2023-machine-unlearning). Just some undergrad friends in HKU & CUHK & UST interested in DL advances. 

## Problem statement from Kaggle

> Deep learning has recently driven tremendous progress in a wide array of applications, ranging from realistic image generation and impressive retrieval systems to language models that can hold human-like conversations. While this progress is very exciting, the widespread use of deep neural network models requires caution: researchers should seek to develop AI technologies responsibly by understanding and mitigating potential risks, such as the propagation and amplification of unfair biases and protecting user privacy. This competition, which has been selected for the NeurIPS'23 competition track, considers a realistic scenario in which an age predictor has been trained on face images, and, after training, a certain subset of the training images must be forgotten to protect the privacy or rights of the individuals concerned.
